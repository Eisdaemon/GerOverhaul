#,Feminism,Feminism,"What precentage of population is self-identifying as feminist this will have consequences if you implement a lot of ""traditionalist"" policies."
#,GenderPayGap,Gender Pay Gap,"Women are getting paid less for doing the same work is the claim. Conservatives say it is a fake claim pointing out that women are choosing badlly paid professions, while liberals only make fake gestures without tackling the problem directlly. According to feminist side it is societal bias that is pushing women into less paid and devauled jobs while creating a glass celling in the corporate lader."

#,Gamblers,Gamblers,"How many people in our country are gamblers, this can create problems down the line."
#,WorkersSituation,Situation of the Workers,"The situation of workers descrive how happy Workers are with their situation in the country. Happy workers are more productive and a good situation makes trade unionists happy."
,PrivatePsychology,Private Psychology,"Psychology is the science of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as feeling and thought. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader neuro-scientific group of researchers. As a social science, it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases."
#,PlasticSurgery,Plastic Surgery,"Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It can be divided into two main categories: reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery. Reconstructive surgery includes craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns. While reconstructive surgery aims to reconstruct a part of the body or improve its functioning, cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery aims at improving the appearance of it. Both of these techniques are used throughout the world."
#,MilitaryPower,Military Strength,"A strong military force is an important part of exerting our influence around the globe and keeping our country safe. There are numerous ways to increase our military's power and reach, resulting in a stronger and more varied fighting force. "
#,GlobalInfluence,Global Influence,"Not all countries have an equal weight when it comes to influencing politics around the world. Those who are economically important, have a powerful military, or are technologically advanced all have an advantage when it comes to global affairs. As we increase our global influence, we will have more sway with other countries of the world. "
#,ForeignThreat,International Threat Assessment,"While all-out-war between global powers has been much less prevalent in the 21st century, inter-country conflict has continued in a more subdued manner. Espionage, election tampering, and cyber-warfare are all tricks of the trade used against rivals. We can reduce this through alliances, military deployment, and retaliatory options. We'll never know our enemies exact plans, so the values that we have are estimations that we believe are near the truth. "

#,SpaceCost,Cost of Space Travel,"Space travel isn't cheap. It takes a lot to propel a vehicle 100 kilometers above the Earth and into space, but there are ways that we can reduce the cost of getting there. By researching new technologies, investing in public space infrastructure, and undertaking missions to increase our level of experience we can get to space much more easily. "
#,CoalPower,Coal fired power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with coal fired power stations. This is the most polluting form of fossil fuel power generation but still remains the most common method of producing electricity globally."
#,NaturalGasPower,Natural gas power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with natural gas power stations. While this is also a fossil fuel based method of generating electricity, natural gas is cleaner burning then coal and produces up to 50% less CO2 then coal fired power stations. This is the second most common method globally of producing electricity and is gradually replacing coal fired power plants."
#,OilPower,Oil burning power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with oil power stations. This method is very uncommon today, only making up 2.9% of the global gross electricity production. It was far more common in earlier days as prices for oil were low. This method produces less pollution then coal but isn't as clean burning as natural gas."
#,RenewablePower,Wind and solar based power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with wind and solar power. Renewable energy, like wind and solar, emit negligible amounts of CO2 during their lifecycle and have become extremely cheap to build. Their drawback is however a low capacity factor and that they're dependant on the weather in order to produce electricity."
#,NuclearPowerGen,Nuclear power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with nuclear power stations. Nuclear power is a low carbon energy source and has emission ratings comparable to renewables. While expensive to build, nuclear power offers reliable baseload electricity with a low price per kWh. The drawbacks include risks for accidents as well as where all the nuclear waste should be stored."
#,EnergyMix,Electricity supply & demand,"This graph shows how much electricity is being produced versus how much is being used. If the graph is in the middle, it means the supply is just enough to meet the demand. If it drops below, it means there's a shortage of electricity and if it goes above the middle, it means there's a surplus of electricity. If it drops too low, we may face power outages but if the graph is up high, we have a surplus that we can export."
#,ElectricityPrice,Electricity price,"The price per kWh that the consumer will pay. This can be affected by many things, for example how electricity is made in the country or if the supply is enough to meet the demand."
#,NuclearWasteAmount,Nuclear waste amount,"A generic measure of how much nuclear waste has gone through initial treatment and is awaiting long term storage. The waste could also be converted back into new uranium-based fuel or mixed oxide fuels for further usage in nuclear reactors. Nuclear waste should be properly dealt with promptly as no one likes having a bunch of highly radioactive waste just sitting in storage pools inside nuclear power stations."
#,HydroPower,Hydroelectricity,"A general measure of how much electricity comes from hydroelectricity. Conventional dams use dammed up water that drives a turbine in order to generate power. There's also pumped storage hydroelectricity where water is pumped from a lower level water reservoir to a higher level in order to ''store'' energy, in the form of graviational potential energy, for later use. When construction is finsihed, hydroelectricity has a low carbon footprint but these facilites tend to disrupt the marine ecosystem where they're built and require a lot of land area."
