#,WorkersSituation,Situation of the Workers,"The situation of workers descrive how happy Workers are with their situation in the country. Happy workers are more productive and a good situation makes trade unionists happy."
,PrivatePsychology,Private Psychology,"Psychology is the science of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as feeling and thought. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader neuro-scientific group of researchers. As a social science, it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases."
#,PlasticSurgery,Plastic Surgery,"Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It can be divided into two main categories: reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery. Reconstructive surgery includes craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns. While reconstructive surgery aims to reconstruct a part of the body or improve its functioning, cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery aims at improving the appearance of it. Both of these techniques are used throughout the world."
#,MilitaryPower,Military Strength,"A strong military force is an important part of exerting our influence around the globe and keeping our country safe. There are numerous ways to increase our military's power and reach, resulting in a stronger and more varied fighting force. "
#,GlobalInfluence,Global Influence,"Not all countries have an equal weight when it comes to influencing politics around the world. Those who are economically important, have a powerful military, or are technologically advanced all have an advantage when it comes to global affairs. As we increase our global influence, we will have more sway with other countries of the world. "
#,ForeignThreat,International Threat Assessment,"While all-out-war between global powers has been much less prevalent in the 21st century, inter-country conflict has continued in a more subdued manner. Espionage, election tampering, and cyber-warfare are all tricks of the trade used against rivals. We can reduce this through alliances, military deployment, and retaliatory options. We'll never know our enemies exact plans, so the values that we have are estimations that we believe are near the truth. "
#,ActualThreat,UNKNOWN,hidden
#,SpaceCost,Cost of Space Travel,"Space travel isn't cheap. It takes a lot to propel a vehicle 100 kilometers above the Earth and into space, but there are ways that we can reduce the cost of getting there. By researching new technologies, investing in public space infrastructure, and undertaking missions to increase our level of experience we can get to space much more easily. "
#,CoalPower,Coal fired power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with coal fired power stations. This is the most polluting form of fossil fuel power generation but still remains the most common method of producing electricity globally."
#,NaturalGasPower,Natural gas power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with natural gas power stations. While this is also a fossil fuel based method of generating electricity, natural gas is cleaner burning then coal and produces up to 50% less CO2 then coal fired power stations. This is the second most common method globally of producing electricity and is gradually replacing coal fired power plants."
#,OilPower,Oil burning power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with oil power stations. This method is very uncommon today, only making up 2.9% of the global gross electricity production. It was far more common in earlier days as prices for oil were low. This method produces less pollution then coal but isn't as clean burning as natural gas."
#,RenewablePower,Wind and solar based power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with wind and solar power. Renewable energy, like wind and solar, emit negligible amounts of CO2 during their lifecycle and have become extremely cheap to build. Their drawback is however a low capacity factor and that they're dependant on the weather in order to produce electricity."
#,NuclearPowerGen,Nuclear power stations,"A general measure of how much electricity is being produced with nuclear power stations. Nuclear power is a low carbon energy source and has emission ratings comparable to renewables. While expensive to build, nuclear power offers reliable baseload electricity with a low price per kWh. The drawbacks include risks for accidents as well as where all the nuclear waste should be stored."
#,EnergyMix,Electricity supply & demand,"This graph shows how much electricity is being produced versus how much is being used. If the graph is in the middle, it means the supply is just enough to meet the demand. If it drops below, it means there's a shortage of electricity and if it goes above the middle, it means there's a surplus of electricity. If it drops too low, we may face power outages but if the graph is up high, we have a surplus that we can export."
#,ElectricityPrice,Electricity price,"The price per kWh that the consumer will pay. This can be affected by many things, for example how electricity is made in the country or if the supply is enough to meet the demand."
#,NuclearWasteAmount,Nuclear waste amount,"A generic measure of how much nuclear waste has gone through initial treatment and is awaiting long term storage. The waste could also be converted back into new uranium-based fuel or mixed oxide fuels for further usage in nuclear reactors. Nuclear waste should be properly dealt with promptly as no one likes having a bunch of highly radioactive waste just sitting in storage pools inside nuclear power stations."
#,HydroPower,Hydroelectricity,"A general measure of how much electricity comes from hydroelectricity. Conventional dams use dammed up water that drives a turbine in order to generate power. There's also pumped storage hydroelectricity where water is pumped from a lower level water reservoir to a higher level in order to ''store'' energy, in the form of graviational potential energy, for later use. When construction is finsihed, hydroelectricity has a low carbon footprint but these facilites tend to disrupt the marine ecosystem where they're built and require a lot of land area."
#,PrisonAvailability,Prison capacity,"A general measure of our prison capacity. A higher value indicates there's a lot of free prison cells and a lower value indicates that unoccupied cells are increasingly harder to find. This measure only shows prison capacity and does not tell you anything about how crowded the prisons are."
#,RecidivismRate,Recidivism rate,"Recidivism rate is the amount of former prisoners who end up getting arrested agagin for criminal actions, even though they've already gotten consequences or gone through a rehabilitation program. This can be caused by many things, such as the individual's circumstances before serving prison time, what happens during the stay in prison and what happens after."
#,PoliceViolence,Police use of force,"A measure of how often the police use force in various situations. Most people will agree on that the police have to use force in certain situations, even lethal force sometimes, but excessive use of force will, to put it mildy, cause friction between the community and police. Various things, such as the policing regime, the level of violence in the country and community policing can affect police use of force."
#,LevelOfViolence,General violence level,"A measure of how common violence is in our country. This includes all forms of violence, both justified and unjustified violence. There's always going to be some levels of violence in society but excessive amounts of violence increases the risk of violence being normalized and accepted as the go-to way of solving issues."
#,PrivateSecurity,Private security industry,"A measure of how big the private security industry is in our country. Private security is often used by the wealthy or big corporations and the presence of a lot of private may not be appreciated by the poor or socialists."
#,SenseOfSecurity,Sense of safety,"A measure of how safe people feel. This is not a measure of crime rates, so people may feel unsafe even though the actual crime rates are low and vice versa. No one really likes feeling unsafe so keeping this number high should be of high priority."
#,CCWHolders,Legal gun ownership,"A measure of how many civilians own legally purchased guns. Some may argue that allowing civilians greater freedom in owning guns will deter crime since criminals will need to think twice about attacking someone. Others will argue that putting more guns into society will just increase the amount of violence further."
#,CivilLiberties,Civil liberties index,"Civil liberties is a broad term that encompasses various liberties and rights that most democratic governments guarantee to their citizens, such as freedom of assembly, freedom of information or freedom of movement. Various policies can increase or decrease the civil liberties index and it's usually considered a good idea to keep the civil liberties index towards the upper end of the graph. Some situations may however justify restricting some civil liberties."
#,PressFreedomIndex,Press freedom index,"In short, freedom of the press means that communication and expression via different forms of media is a right that can be freely exercised. This index shows how free the media in our country is. Some restriction of press freedom may be justified, such as banning publishing state secrets, whereas other restrictions may be too far reaching."
#,PoliceCommunityRelations,Police - community relations,"A general measure of how good the relation between the community and police force is. A good relation means that people have high thoughts of the police and will for example be more likely to report crimes. A bad relationship may mean people may not trust that the police will protect them if they report serious crimes."
#,IllegalDrugConsumption,Illegal narcotics consumption,"An estimate of the quantity of illegal narcotics that are being consumed. Legalizing narcotics may get more people to buy legal narcotics instead of sourcing their substance of choice from criminal gangs. On the other side, too stringent regulations and taxation on legal narcotics may push people back to the illegal stuff."
#,PrisonerPerCell,Prison overcrowding,"A measure of how overcrowded your prison system is. Excessive overcrowding may lead to increased violence inside prison as well as prisoner riots. Some argue that crowded living conditions may harm the prisoners' chances to get rehabilitated and poor living conditions in prisons could attract international criticism. On the other hand, others argue that we shouldn't spend more then necessary on criminals because the purpose of prison is to punish them."
#,MakeCrimeHarder,Crime difficulty increase,"Simulation to make crime harder to deal with."
#,MakeViolentCrimeHarder,Violent crime difficulty increase,"Simulation to make violent crime harder to deal with."
#,DefenseLicenseAmount,Concealed carry license holders,"A measure of how many people have a conceal carry weapon license. This is highly dependant on the gun laws, self defense laws and of course, whether or not concealed carry of firearms is allowed."
#,PrisonConditions,Prison conditions,"The living conditions inside our prison system. A high value represents a prison system where prisoners are treated well and have access to facilities such as health care. A low value represents overcrowded, dirty prisons where prisoners are often sujected to highly questionable treatment."
#,AuthoritarianismAmount,Authoritarianism Index,"How authoritarian is your governmnet? Limiting civil liberties and press freedom too much will raise your authoritarianism index. Some policies may not decrease civil liberties but may still be seen as authoritarian. Being too authoritarian could harm our foreign relations."
#,OpressionPower,Oppressive powers,"If you ever decided to ''guide'' democracy in the right direction, how successful would that be? This is a measure of how well your ''adjustments'' to democracy would work. It is affected by policies which can be used as tools to ''teach'' opposition political parties, individuals and such why their opinion is wrong. Policies include things like media censorship, internet censorship and a well funded secret service."
