,PrivatePsychology,Private Psychology,"Psychology is the science of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as feeling and thought. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader neuro-scientific group of researchers. As a social science, it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases."
#,PlasticSurgery,Plastic Surgery,"Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It can be divided into two main categories: reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery. Reconstructive surgery includes craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns. While reconstructive surgery aims to reconstruct a part of the body or improve its functioning, cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery aims at improving the appearance of it. Both of these techniques are used throughout the world."
#,MilitaryPower,Military Strength,"A strong military force is an important part of exerting our influence around the globe and keeping our country safe. There are numerous ways to increase our military's power and reach, resulting in a stronger and more varied fighting force. "
#,GlobalInfluence,Global Influence,"Not all countries have an equal weight when it comes to influencing politics around the world. Those who are economically important, have a powerful military, or are technologically advanced all have an advantage when it comes to global affairs. As we increase our global influence, we will have more sway with other countries of the world. "
#,ForeignThreat,International Threat Assessment,"While all-out-war between global powers has been much less prevalent in the 21st century, inter-country conflict has continued in a more subdued manner. Espionage, election tampering, and cyber-warfare are all tricks of the trade used against rivals. We can reduce this through alliances, military deployment, and retaliatory options. We'll never know our enemies exact plans, so the values that we have are estimations that we believe are near the truth. "

#,SpaceCost,Cost of Space Travel,"Space travel isn't cheap. It takes a lot to propel a vehicle 100 kilometers above the Earth and into space, but there are ways that we can reduce the cost of getting there. By researching new technologies, investing in public space infrastructure, and undertaking missions to increase our level of experience we can get to space much more easily. "
#,FossilFuelPower,Fossil fuel power,"A general measure of the amount of fossil fuel power stations in our country, such as coal fired power plants and natural gas power plants. This type of electricity production is highly carbon intensive and causes environmental pollution. Most of the world's electricity comes from fossil fuel sources and coal power is the most environmentally harmful method to generate electricity. Oil and gas fired power plants also cause pollution but to a lesser extend then coal."
#,RenewablePower,Renewable power,"A general measure of the amount of renewable power in our country, such as wind, solar and hydro power. Renewable energy produces negligible amounts of CO2 but they require a lot of land in order to produce meaningful amounts of electricity or an amount that can match a fossil fuel power plant or nuclear plant. Some renewables, such as wind and solar, depend on the weather to generate electricity, which can drive up electricity costs for the consumers."
#,NuclearPowerGen,Nuclear power,"A general measure of the amount of nuclear power stations in our country, such as fission reactors. Nuclear power has emissions comparable to renewable sources but without using large amounts of land. There is however the risk of catastrofic accidents such as reactor meltdowns and the issue of where the spent nuclear fuel should be stored safely."
#,EnergyMix,Electricity supply & demand,"This graph shows how much electricity is being produced versus how much is being used. If the graph is in the middle, it means the supply is just enough to meet the demand. If it drops below, it means there's a shortage of electricity and if it goes above the middle, it means there's a surplus of electricity. If it drops too low, we may face power outages but if the graph is up high, we have a surplus that we can export."
#,ElectricityPrice,Electricity price,"The price per kWh that the consumer will pay. This can be affected by many things, for example how electricity is made in the country or if the supply is enough to meet the demand."
#,ElectricityFromFossil,Fossil based power generation,"A measure of how much electricity actually comes from fossil fuels."
#,ElectricityFromNuclear,Nuclear power generation,"A measure of how much electricity actually comes from nuclear power."
#,ElectricityFromRenewable,Renewable power generation,"A measure of how much electricity actually comes from renewable sources."
#,NuclearWasteAmount,Nuclear waste amount,"A generic measure of how much nuclear waste has gone through initial treatment and is awaiting long term storage. The waste could be converted back into new uranium-based fuel or mixed oxide fuels for further usage in nuclear reactors."
