#,NATODefense,NATO Defense Mission,Ukraine has called upon our alliance outlined in the NATO agreement and is asking for a joint deployment of troops to protect against an ongoing Russian attack. Several countries within the alliance are waiting to see what we do and then follow suite. Patriots argue that the current Ukrainian administration doesn't make a contribution worthwhile enough to go to battle for. 
#,NATODefense_0,Deploy Troops: Protect Ally,"We knew what we signed up for when we began contributing forces to the alliance. If we don't intervene now, it will be setting a dangerous precedent regarding the strength of the allied bonds we share. "
#,NATODefense_1,Don't Defend Ally,"We can't afford to bail this ally out, especially when they contribute so little to this alliance. Russia is a powerful country, and it's likely that going to battle here will have major consequences for us. Unfortunately, this time we will not answer the call to action. "
#,ClearSpaceJunk,Clear Space Junk?,"An international coalition has come up with a plan to remove some of the space junk that currently resides in the Earth's atmosphere. To perform the act, they'll need several space-faring countries to commit to lifting the financial burden necessary. Your country is on the short list of those who are being tapped for assistance. If you agree, this will not be a cheap venture. ", 
#,ClearSpaceJunk_0,Contribute to Space Junk Cleanup,"The space junk will have to be dealt with at some point. We may as well remove it now when other countries are willing to cooperate rather than later. Getting rid of this orbiting junk will decrease the cost of space travel and will make the entire process more feasible, so we should certainly contribute. ",
#,ClearSpaceJunk_1,Don't Contribute to Space Junk,"We can't afford to spend a lumpsum this large on clearing space junk out. We have much more important things to worry about! Besides, we can work around it in our own space travels and make up for it with technology and experience. ",
#,ForeignLunarBase,Foreign Access to Lunar Base?,"Now that we have dedicated resources to building a permanent presence on the moon, foreign countries around the globe are asking for access to our base. This could be to perform experiments, refuel their spacecraft, or any other number of uses. Patriots in our country are saying that they shouldn't have access unless they provide space-related assistance to us. ",
#,ForeignLunarBase_0,Allow Foreign Governments Access,"As humanity ventures into the stars, it's time to put aside the petty notions of nationalism and inter-country-conflict. We would be glad to open our doors (er- airlocks) and greet them with open arms on the lunar surface. ",
#,ForeignLunarBase_1,Don't Allow Foreign Governments Access,"We are going to be spending a huge amount of resources on this lunar base. If other countries want to get the same benefits the base provides, there should be something in it for us. We aren't here to offer free handouts to propel the world into space.",
#,MarsMissionLead,Choose Mars Mission Lead,"As our Mars Program takes off and prepares for a manned mission to the red planet, the question has arisen regarding who we will be sending. There are currently three equally qualified candidates for mission lead. The face that you choose will likely have a large national impact considering the scope of our mission. ",
#,MarsMissionLead_0,Appoint Christine White ,"Christine White has been a part of the Space Program for quite some time now and has already taken part in several space-based scientific discoveries in the past. She is quick to emphasize the importance of working together as a unified planet as we reach towards the stars, and has engaged in numerous humanitarian efforts. ",
#,MarsMissionLead_1,Appoint Victor Martinez,"Victor Martinez has entered into the Space Program after a long-career in the military. Martinez was at the top of his unit, awarded numerous times for outstanding service. Beyond this, he has long been an advocate of traditional values and the country of yester-year, making him popular with conservatives. ",
#,MarsMissionLead_2,Appoint Trever Satterfield,"Trever Satterfield has been involved in ongoing space-missions for the past few years, but not under our national umbrella. They instead have been working for private aerospace firms. Enlisting the help of the private sector's premiere astronaut is sure to show good graces towards the companies that reside in our country. ",
#,SpaceForceGlobal,Abide by Space Demilitarization?,"Several countries around the world have noticed that we are now funneling money into a branch of our military dedicated to space-based projects. The United Nations is now looking to us, asking if we intend on honoring their wishes of keeping space as a demilitarized zone. If we agree, it will make us appear favorable on the world's stage. However, it will also limit the capabilities of our military. ",
#,SpaceForceGlobal_0,Honor Demilitarization Wishes,"It only makes sense to keep space as a peaceful zone. If we open the can of worms that is space-based warfare, there could be an unseen amount of devasation that follows. We will abide by the rules set in place by the UN and make sure that our military presence in space amounts only to a defensive, utilitarian one. ",
#,SpaceForceGlobal_1,Deploy Orbital Military Forces,"Even if we were to agree to keep our military out of space, what would stop any one of our rivals from doing the same? If we are to maintain a permanent presence and foothold in space, there can be no concessions to organizations like the UN. This is a matter of national security and will not to be governed by anyone but us. ",
#,TVProfanity,Profanity on TV,"Last weekend, the first episode of a new, satirical television show was aired. The content of the show has caused public outrage in the country and some are even calling for the government to tighten the legislation about what you can and cannot show on TV. The show in question featured controversial content such as depictions of racism, extreme profanity, nudity and sexually explicit scenes."
#,TVProfanity_0,Denounce the show.,"This television show is vile. While I understand that it's a satirical show, they take it too far with their extremely racist commentary and full nudity. This shouldn't be showed on television. There's other channels where shows like this can be watched by the degenerates of society."
#,TVProfanity_1,Support the show.,"I get that some people might be upset by the content of this TV show, but here's a newsflash: no one's forcing you to watch it! Just change the channel. We have freedom of speech and expression in this country, and that covers controversial television shows as well!"
#,SelfDefenseCase1,Controversial self defense stabbing,"Last month, an attempted robbery led to the death of two teens, aged 15 and 16. Armed with a metal rod and a wrench, the duo demanded money, alcohol and cigarettes from the store owner. The situation quickly escalated into a physical confrontation when one of the teens started smashing the cash register and the other started advancing on the store owner. The store owner pulled out a machete from under the counter and started swinging it widly at the would-be robbers. Both teens died on scene and the store owner suffered minor bruises. This has sparked a massive debate about our self defense laws and what reasonable force actually is. You're being asked by media to voice your opinion on the situation"
#,SelfDefenseCase1_0,Take the teens' side,"One has the right to defend themselves from violence and to defend their property from theft. With that said, it all has to be proportional. You can't just start wildly swinging a machete at two kids and say it's self defense. The store owner, a full grown man, could have easily defended his store and himself without that machete against two kids with a metal rod and wrench. Preserving life should always be the priority!"
#,SelfDefenseCase1_1,Take store owner's side,"It's tragic that two lives were extinguished that day. But no one forced those teens to do drugs and then go try to rob a store, armed with potentially lethal weapons. If someone comes into your business or home, with a weapon, and starts demanding money, they mean you harm. They're not there to have a coffee with you. It's reasonable to assume that those drug addicted teens would have seriously injured or murdered the store owner had he not acted to defend himself. The way I see it is that this is a schoolbook example of self defense."
#,SelfDefenseCase1_2,Take no sides.,"I know people expect comments from the government when a high profile, controversial case like this is on the agenda. I however refuse to take sides. We have laws, regulations and practices regarding self defense and I think we should just let the courts decide whether or not this is self defense. No matter the outcome, this is indeed a tragic situation for everyone involved. "
#,MilitaryAgainstRiots,Deploy military against riots?,"You're approached by your security advisor. ''We really need to consider putting a stop to these riots. The police has lost control as it's still ongoing. How about we deploy the military to take control of our cities? Sure, there might be some violence and deaths, but it's going to end the riots quickly and efficiently'', says the security advisor. You think about it for a while and are ready to make a statement about it."
#,MilitaryAgainstRiots_0,Deploy the military,"Due to the ongoing riots, and due to the fact that the police has not been able to regain control, we've decided to deploy the military in order to restore law and order. Some areas will be put under martial law and those who do not obey miliary orders risk being detained. Those who commit violent acts risk being shot. Enough is enough!"
#,MilitaryAgainstRiots_1,Do not deploy the military,"We've decided to not deploy the military to stop the ongoing riots. This is not a military threat, it's an issue for the police to deal with and they're doing a great job so far. We need to let the police do their work without military interference."
#,MilitaryAgainstRiots_2,Do not deploy the military & fire advisor,"One of the government advisors expressed the absurd idea of deploying the armed forces against the ongoing riots. That's something that belongs in dictatorships and not in democratic countries. These riots need to stop, yes, but they aren't issues for the military to deal with. I do not want warmongers anywhere close to my government so I've decided to fire the security advisor immediately."
