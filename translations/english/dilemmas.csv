#,NATODefense,NATO Defense Mission,Ukraine has called upon our alliance outlined in the NATO agreement and is asking for a joint deployment of troops to protect against an ongoing Russian attack. Several countries within the alliance are waiting to see what we do and then follow suite. Patriots argue that the current Ukrainian administration doesn't make a contribution worthwhile enough to go to battle for. 
#,NATODefense_0,Deploy Troops: Protect Ally,"We knew what we signed up for when we began contributing forces to the alliance. If we don't intervene now, it will be setting a dangerous precedent regarding the strength of the allied bonds we share. "
#,NATODefense_1,Don't Defend Ally,"We can't afford to bail this ally out, especially when they contribute so little to this alliance. Russia is a powerful country, and it's likely that going to battle here will have major consequences for us. Unfortunately, this time we will not answer the call to action. "
