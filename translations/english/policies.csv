#,TourismTax,Tourism Tax,"Some within our country have made calls for a tax on tourism, so that those who wish to visit are contributing to the country's wallet even more directly than they were previously. Patriots fully support such a tax, under the belief that those who visit should contribute to our country in return. Capitalists aren't as happy, seeing this as unnecessary meddling in a profitable industry. "#,ProstitutionTax,Prostitution Tax,"The sex work industry is yet another that has had taxation proposed around it once legalized. Opponents argue that the government shouldn't be making any revenue off of an industry as scandalous as this.

#,GamblingTax,Gambling Tax,"One of the benefits that has been associated with the prospect of legal gambling is a ""Gaming Tax"".

#,Seducation,Sex education,"Sex education is the instruction of issues relating to human sexuality, including emotional relations and responsibilities, human sexual anatomy, sexual activity, sexual reproduction, age of consent, reproductive health, reproductive rights, safe sex, birth control and sexual abstinence. Sex education that covers all of these aspects is known as comprehensive sex education. Common avenues for sex education are parents or caregivers, formal school programs, and public health campaigns."
#,TaxCodeStrength,Tax Code Strength,"Our global, digital age is fraught with opportunity. One of the many opportunities that has been afforded is the ability to pay very little in taxes and, sometimes, avoid government revenue collection altogether. If we were to strengthen our tax code or even potentially rewrite it, we could clamp down on and reduce tax fraud. Capitalists are vehemently opposed to such an idea, as are the wealthy"

#,MenstrualLeave,Menstrual Leave,"Menstrual leave is a type of leave where a woman may have the option to take paid or unpaid leave from her employment if she is menstruating and is unable to go to work because of this. According to a study, out of the 40% of women who are part of the labor force 20% experience a condition called dysmenorrhea that causes pain during menstruation. Menstrual leave is controversial because it is seen by some as a criticism of women's work efficiency or as sexism. Meanwhile, those who support menstrual leave policies compare its function to that of maternity leave and view it as a promoter of gender equality."
#,StatePsychology,State Psychology,Mental Health is a right!
#,armsexports,Arms Exports,"While controversial, some countries look to selling weapons and other items of war to the highest bidder as a potential revenue source. Lower levels of this practice may involve only selling to allies, while high levels allow one to open the gates and become a global arms dealer to anyone who needs it. Liberals dislike spreading more wepaons of war. Patriots are opposed to the idea as well, except for when it comes to selling to allies. "
#,natomembership,NATO Membership,"NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an intergovernmental military alliance of countries in the Americas and Europe. Created after World War II as a response to future threats from the Germans and Russians, the alliance means that if any country in the pact is attacked then the others will come to their aid. High levels of involvement will boost relations with other members, but will weaken the military benefit provided since you'll now be supplying it. "
#,elderlyinterneted,Elderly Internet Education Program,"The modern day version of the internet is still relatively new and many of our elderly citizens struggle to use it. Their lack of tech skills result in increased cyber crime and spread of fake news. By starting a program with the purpose of educating senior citizens on the use of technology and the internet, we can reduce some of these issues. "
#,aliensearch,Search for Extraterrestrial Life,"For as long as man as been able to look up to the stars, we have asked ourselves the same question time and time again. Are we alone in the universe? Some see the search for extraterrestrial life as an essential scientific duty; a duty that would best be carried out by a government. This agency will scan through the cosmos to try to find a trace of whatever is, or isn't, out there. "
#,shuttleresearch,Shuttle Research Grants,"One of the largest impediments to space travel as it stands now is shuttle design. The space shuttles that are currently in use are lacking in numerous departments and are in desparate need of being brought into the 21st century. By supplying research grants, we can improve on many shuttle features including: core design, engine systems, life support, and more. "
#,privatespacesub,Aerospace Industry Subsidies,"Aerospace technology is an incredibly difficult industry to thrive in, especially when it comes to projects involving space and space travel. It may be many years or even decades before any of these companies start turning a profit. We can divert some of our assets to assist these companies as they navigate through the awkward, early-years of the space industry. "
#,lunarbase,Moon Base,"Ever since the United States landed on the moon in 1969, humanity has dreamed of a permanent presence on the moon. With the technology of the 21st century, it may finally be possible. Building a moon base would greatly decrease the cost of space travel, giving us a refueling platform for vessels. A lunar base would also allow us access to lunar mining industries, giving us a large number of energy and rare earth resources. "
#,spaceforce,Space Force,"A new age calls for a new branch of the military. By creating a space force, we will be solidifying our hold on space and future-proofing our armed forces. As more and more nations move upwards, it is likely that rivalries will follow them. Our space force may consist of military satellites, sensor equipment, asteroid interception tools, and potentially even combat vessels. "
#,openspacescience,Space Tech Global Research Agreement,"We're going to need all the help that we can get if we're going to push humanity towards it's rightful space in the stars. However, most countries around the world are struggling to get their space programs off the ground. By sharing everything that we know technologically in regards to space travel, we'll be opening up a new avenue of cooperation with world powers. However, this could keep us from ever truly having a technological advantage. "
#,banprivatespace,Ban Private Aerospace Programs,"Considered a drastic step by many, banning private aerospace companies in your country is a measure that can be taken to prevent the free-market from spilling into space. This policy will ensure that space is purely for scientific and government merit, allowing the rat race of modern life to stay contained to the Earth. "

#,spacemirrors,Space Mirrors, An expensive Project to block Sunlight in order to fight the increase of global temperature. Since it is very expensive it should be only used as a last resort.
#,SustainableIndustryTransition,Sustainable Industry Transition,"With the effects of climate change, plastic polution and excessive waste production being apparent, a blanket Sustainable Industry Transition policy paves the way to a cleaner economy. This is through investment in sustainable practices and regulation. Through increasingly sustainable use of resources and greater investment, the economy also recieves a boost in the long term. Environmentalists praise the policy whilst Captalists see it as an unnecessary distortion of the market."
#,immigranttax,Immigrant Tax,"An immigrant tax consists of a one-time fee that is paid by an individual when they choose to move to our country. Depending on our immigration levels, this can bring in quite a bit of revenue. Patriots approve of this policy, seeing it as immigrants contributing to the country that they're moving to. Liberals and minorities disapprove, citing that many who need to relocate most won't have the funds necessary to move. "
#,abroadtax,Earned-Income Abroad Tax,"Typically, the income that is earned by individuals who reside here but work in another country is taxed by the country that they are residing in, rather than ours. However, we can institute a policy in which we tax this income as well, earning revnue from our citizens who aren't residing within our country currently. This tax tends to disproportionately affect capitalists (who frequently travel the world for work) and self-employed people (many of whom are positioned in foreign countries). "
#,negativeincometax,Negative Income Tax,"While welfare is traditionally seen as less than desirable to capitalists, there exists another alternative to UBI and the welfare state. A negative income tax is a reverse tax. That is, if you make under a certain amount each year, rather than paying in to the system you will receive a payment proportional to what it takes to get to that aforementioned amount. It tends to reduce the threat of poverty traps as well as giving money only to those who truly need it. "
#,landtax,Land Value Tax,"Unlike traditional property taxes, a land-value tax does not take into account anything built on the land. It only taxes the value of the land itself. This leads to an incentive to build and develop on the land, which can cause growth in GDP and opens up further development in urban areas rather than having to move outward. The wealthy will be unhappy with this, as it is yet another tax on one of their greatest assets. "
#,ConstructionSubsidy,House Construction Subsidies,"An alternative to state housing, the government subsidizes the construction of affordable homes. This program is costly, but it creates many jobs and increases the supply of housing while reducing housing costs."
#,workerspride,Workers Pride Campaign,"A large public awareness and advertising campaign promoting the pride of working towards a common goal, with the basic message that both surgeon and street-cleaner are vital and equal contributors to society. Trade unions will be pleased, and workers spurred to work a little harder if they feel respected equally. Patriots may also be encouraged by the nationalist message, but the wealthy may resent the comparison to low-paid workers."
#,publicworks,Public Works Project,"A renewal of New Deal ideas, the Federal Works Agency offers low-skilled unemployed citizens productive work across the country clearing rubbish, building public works, repainting and maintaining road and cities, and generally making themselves useful. While this brings money to the vulnerable, the working conditions are spartan and do not satisfy the unions. However, the FWA does beautify the nation, which can attract tourists, and pleases groups who prefer to see the unemployed kept busy."
#,monitortransactions,Monitor Large Financial Transactions,"Intelligence sources are warning of the possible dangers of the shadowy 'Battenburg Group', an international network of wealthy industrialists. Unlike most terrorist groups, the military wing is based primarily on apolitical agents acting for money, which means that an effort to scrutinise large transactions and prevent the funding of these individuals could be effective. However, this could also harrass legitimate business and innocent (wealthy) people."
#,immigrationskills,Skilled Immigrants,"While serious economic reforms may be too much to take for some professional workers, there are others abroad eager to take their place in return for a chance at a better life. A series of incentives can convince skilled foreigners to make our nation their home and replace loss through expatriation. The fairer a deal they feel they will get, the less payout be needed. Of course, nationalists are offended at the prospect, and some in the international community see our measures as poaching."
,constitutionalreform,Constitutional Reform,"While our nation's founding documents outline important rights and protections and have served us well, they fail to reflect some of the most basic needs in our society. What use is freedom of expression when lacking a place to sleep or food to eat? Reform will formalise our responsibility to provide them for all, and, so long as they are, please egalitarians. Of course, changing a consitution seen as sacred is politically difficult and will anger others. (CANNOT CANCEL!!) "
,ideologicaleducation,Ideological Education,"Children are our future, and the future of our society, but all too often we leave them ill-equipped to deal with the political debates of our times, instead letting celebrities and the corporate media decide their path. A comprehensive schools program to encourage constructive, egalitarian ideals in future generations could have positive consequences."
,nationalisetransport,State Ran Transport Services,"Our transport services have been left in total disrepair under the stewardship of the free markets, that have provided the minimum possible service at the maximum prices. It's about time we stop subsiding transit corporations while they privatise the profits. We can improve efficiency and quality by taking our trains, busses and airports back into public ownership, to the benefit of the passengers. Unfortunately, motorists may resent the extra focus on public transport."
,nationalisebanking,State Banking,"The heart of modern capitalism is the banking and finance system, and the world is convinced that neo-liberalism is the only option. However, our radical plan to take control of banking at a state level would allow a more ethical system with fairer loan terms, and ending irresponsible takeovers and asset stripping could bolster the economy. While socialists will be overjoyed, expect the capitalists to defend their crown jewel at any cost."
,nationaliseservices,State Ran Services,"With the cost of living spiralling at roughly the same rate as energy company profits, renationalising essential state services and controlling prices would allow a reprieve for the poor and to an extent the middle-class. Reducing the costs of energy, heating, water, and other services could improve the situation of the overall economy, but of course capitalists will not be pleased at the loss of a highly profitable market."
#,ProstitutionTax,Sex Work Tax,"The sex work industry is yet another that has had taxation proposed around it once legalized. Opponents argue that the government shouldn't be making any revenue off of an industry as scandalous as this. Others also point out that the poor will be affected at a much higher level than those who have the funds to pay, thus creating yet another luxury tax. "
