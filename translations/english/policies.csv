#,TourismTax,Tourism Tax,"Some within our country have made calls for a tax on tourism, so that those who wish to visit are contributing to the country's wallet even more directly than they were previously. Patriots fully support such a tax, under the belief that those who visit should contribute to our country in return. Capitalists aren't as happy, seeing this as unnecessary meddling in a profitable industry. "#,ProstitutionTax,Prostitution Tax,"The sex work industry is yet another that has had taxation proposed around it once legalized. Opponents argue that the government shouldn't be making any revenue off of an industry as scandalous as this. Others also point out that the poor will be affected at a much higher level than those who have the funds to pay, thus creating yet another luxury tax. "

#,Seducation,Sex education,"Sex education is the instruction of issues relating to human sexuality, including emotional relations and responsibilities, human sexual anatomy, sexual activity, sexual reproduction, age of consent, reproductive health, reproductive rights, safe sex, birth control and sexual abstinence. Sex education that covers all of these aspects is known as comprehensive sex education. Common avenues for sex education are parents or caregivers, formal school programs, and public health campaigns."
#,TaxCodeStrength,Tax Code Strength,"Our global, digital age is fraught with opportunity. One of the many opportunities that has been afforded is the ability to pay very little in taxes and, sometimes, avoid government revenue collection altogether. If we were to strengthen our tax code or even potentially rewrite it, we could clamp down on and reduce tax fraud. Capitalists are vehemently opposed to such an idea, as are the wealthy"

#,MenstrualLeave,Menstrual Leave,"Menstrual leave is a type of leave where a woman may have the option to take paid or unpaid leave from her employment if she is menstruating and is unable to go to work because of this. According to a study, out of the 40% of women who are part of the labor force 20% experience a condition called dysmenorrhea that causes pain during menstruation. Menstrual leave is controversial because it is seen by some as a criticism of women's work efficiency or as sexism. Meanwhile, those who support menstrual leave policies compare its function to that of maternity leave and view it as a promoter of gender equality."

#,armsexports,Arms Exports,"While controversial, some countries look to selling weapons and other items of war to the highest bidder as a potential revenue source. Lower levels of this practice may involve only selling to allies, while high levels allow one to open the gates and become a global arms dealer to anyone who needs it. Liberals dislike spreading more wepaons of war. Patriots are opposed to the idea as well, except for when it comes to selling to allies. "
#,natomembership,NATO Membership,"NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an intergovernmental military alliance of countries in the Americas and Europe. Created after World War II as a response to future threats from the Germans and Russians, the alliance means that if any country in the pact is attacked then the others will come to their aid. High levels of involvement will boost relations with other members, but will weaken the military benefit provided since you'll now be supplying it. "
#,elderlyinterneted,Elderly Internet Education Program,"The modern day version of the internet is still relatively new and many of our elderly citizens struggle to use it. Their lack of tech skills result in increased cyber crime and spread of fake news. By starting a program with the purpose of educating senior citizens on the use of technology and the internet, we can reduce some of these issues. "
#,aliensearch,Search for Extraterrestrial Life,"For as long as man as been able to look up to the stars, we have asked ourselves the same question time and time again. Are we alone in the universe? Some see the search for extraterrestrial life as an essential scientific duty; a duty that would best be carried out by a government. This agency will scan through the cosmos to try to find a trace of whatever is, or isn't, out there. "
#,shuttleresearch,Shuttle Research Grants,"One of the largest impediments to space travel as it stands now is shuttle design. The space shuttles that are currently in use are lacking in numerous departments and are in desparate need of being brought into the 21st century. By supplying research grants, we can improve on many shuttle features including: core design, engine systems, life support, and more. "
#,privatespacesub,Aerospace Industry Subsidies,"Aerospace technology is an incredibly difficult industry to thrive in, especially when it comes to projects involving space and space travel. It may be many years or even decades before any of these companies start turning a profit. We can divert some of our assets to assist these companies as they navigate through the awkward, early-years of the space industry. "
#,lunarbase,Moon Base,"Ever since the United States landed on the moon in 1969, humanity has dreamed of a permanent presence on the moon. With the technology of the 21st century, it may finally be possible. Building a moon base would greatly decrease the cost of space travel, giving us a refueling platform for vessels. A lunar base would also allow us access to lunar mining industries, giving us a large number of energy and rare earth resources. "
#,spaceforce,Space Force,"A new age calls for a new branch of the military. By creating a space force, we will be solidifying our hold on space and future-proofing our armed forces. As more and more nations move upwards, it is likely that rivalries will follow them. Our space force may consist of military satellites, sensor equipment, asteroid interception tools, and potentially even combat vessels. "
#,openspacescience,Space Tech Global Research Agreement,"We're going to need all the help that we can get if we're going to push humanity towards it's rightful space in the stars. However, most countries around the world are struggling to get their space programs off the ground. By sharing everything that we know technologically in regards to space travel, we'll be opening up a new avenue of cooperation with world powers. However, this could keep us from ever truly having a technological advantage. "
#,banprivatespace,Ban Private Aerospace Programs,"Considered a drastic step by many, banning private aerospace companies in your country is a measure that can be taken to prevent the free-market from spilling into space. This policy will ensure that space is purely for scientific and government merit, allowing the rat race of modern life to stay contained to the Earth. "

#,SustainableIndustryTransition,Sustainable Industry Transition,"With the effects of climate change, plastic polution and excessive waste production being apparent, a blanket Sustainable Industry Transition policy paves the way to a cleaner economy. This is through investment in sustainable practices and regulation. Through increasingly sustainable use of resources and greater investment, the economy also recieves a boost in the long term. Environmentalists praise the policy whilst Captalists see it as an unnecessary distortion of the market."
#,immigranttax,Immigrant Tax,"An immigrant tax consists of a one-time fee that is paid by an individual when they choose to move to our country. Depending on our immigration levels, this can bring in quite a bit of revenue. Patriots approve of this policy, seeing it as immigrants contributing to the country that they're moving to. Liberals and minorities disapprove, citing that many who need to relocate most won't have the funds necessary to move. "
#,abroadtax,Earned-Income Abroad Tax,"Typically, the income that is earned by individuals who reside here but work in another country is taxed by the country that they are residing in, rather than ours. However, we can institute a policy in which we tax this income as well, earning revnue from our citizens who aren't residing within our country currently. This tax tends to disproportionately affect capitalists (who frequently travel the world for work) and self-employed people (many of whom are positioned in foreign countries). "
#,negativeincometax,Negative Income Tax,"While welfare is traditionally seen as less than desirable to capitalists, there exists another alternative to UBI and the welfare state. A negative income tax is a reverse tax. That is, if you make under a certain amount each year, rather than paying in to the system you will receive a payment proportional to what it takes to get to that aforementioned amount. It tends to reduce the threat of poverty traps as well as giving money only to those who truly need it. "
#,landtax,Land Value Tax,"Unlike traditional property taxes, a land-value tax does not take into account anything built on the land. It only taxes the value of the land itself. This leads to an incentive to build and develop on the land, which can cause growth in GDP and opens up further development in urban areas rather than having to move outward. The wealthy will be unhappy with this, as it is yet another tax on one of their greatest assets. "
#,ConstructionSubsidy,House Construction Subsidies,"An alternative to state housing, the government subsidizes the construction of affordable homes. This program is costly, but it creates many jobs and increases the supply of housing while reducing housing costs."
#,workerspride,Workers Pride Campaign,"A large public awareness and advertising campaign promoting the pride of working towards a common goal, with the basic message that both surgeon and street-cleaner are vital and equal contributors to society. Trade unions will be pleased, and workers spurred to work a little harder if they feel respected equally. Patriots may also be encouraged by the nationalist message, but the wealthy may resent the comparison to low-paid workers."
#,publicworks,Public Works Project,"A renewal of New Deal ideas, the Federal Works Agency offers low-skilled unemployed citizens productive work across the country clearing rubbish, building public works, repainting and maintaining road and cities, and generally making themselves useful. While this brings money to the vulnerable, the working conditions are spartan and do not satisfy the unions. However, the FWA does beautify the nation, which can attract tourists, and pleases groups who prefer to see the unemployed kept busy."
#,monitortransactions,Monitor Large Financial Transactions,"Intelligence sources are warning of the possible dangers of the shadowy 'Battenburg Group', an international network of wealthy industrialists. Unlike most terrorist groups, the military wing is based primarily on apolitical agents acting for money, which means that an effort to scrutinise large transactions and prevent the funding of these individuals could be effective. However, this could also harrass legitimate business and innocent (wealthy) people."
#,ProstitutionTax,Sex Work Tax,"The sex work industry is yet another that has had taxation proposed around it once legalized. Opponents argue that the government shouldn't be making any revenue off of an industry as scandalous as this. Others also point out that the poor will be affected at a much higher level than those who have the funds to pay, thus creating yet another luxury tax. "
#,skilledimmigration,Skilled Immgiration Incentives,"All around the world, there is brilliance hidden in every corner. By setting up immigration incentives for the most highly-skilled individuals around the world, we can utilize the full-breadth of human capital available to us internationally. Foreign nations will likely disapprove of these measures at high levels, as it takes their talent from them. Patriots are likely to dislike this idea since they view it as taking jobs from our citizens. "
#,immigrationenforcement,Immigration Enforcement Force,"In recent years, there has been an outcry from more patriotically minded individuals regarding the dangers that illegal immigration poses. To reduce the number of illegal immigrants living in the country, we can assemble an Immigration Enforcement Force that works around the clock to find those who are here illegally and deport them. "
#,unmembership,United Nations Membership,The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization whose primary purpose is to maintain international peace and security. It accomplishes this goal through fostering active cooperation and friendly relations between nations. The organization is supported through the financial contributions of many of its members. We can choose how much to put forward with larger amounts giving us more sway and a stronger UN. 
#,secretservice,Secret Service,"Being the leader of a nation typically entails making a lot of people angry. For those radical enough, this anger can oftentimes turn into violence. By creating a private guard of our nation's leadership, we will be able to prevent any kind of harm. We'll need a good intelligence network however, to make full use of these guardians. "
#,ElectricityImport,Electricity import,"If the country is unable to produce enough electricity to cover its demand, one option is to import electricity from neighboring countries. This is a quick solution to avoid blackouts or a shortage of electricity but it could be interpreted as a sign of weakness in our energy industry by some people. There's also the risk that the electricity we're importing comes from dirty sources such as coal fired power plants, since we do not have control over other countries' electricity production."
#,ElectricityExport,Electricity export,"If the country has a surplus of electricity, one alternative to maintaining balance in the power grid is exporting the surplus. This obviously generates income for the country and can be beneficial for the environmnet if our energy mix has a lower emission rating then whoever we're exporting electricity to."
#,NuclearWasteEndStorage,Long term nuclear waste storage,"High level nuclear waste as well as spent nuclear fuel are highly radioactive materials that require proper shielding and cooling in order to protect humans and the environment from the harmful radiation. Long term storage includes methods such as dry cask storage or geological disposal. This policy will fund such long term storage solutions so that waste from our reactors can be safely stored and disposed off. "
#,NuclearWasteReprocessing,Nuclear waste reprocessing,"Nuclear waste reprocessing are methods which you can use to essentially ''recycle'' nuclear waste to get new fissile material that can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors. This can be quite expensive but it's a great way to re-use nuclear waste instead of just storing it somewhere. Environmentalists will be opposed to this as they will see it as a further expansion of the nuclear industry."
#,FossilElectricityBan,Fossil fuel electricity phase-out,"Fossil fuel based electricity generation is the most common method worldwide for generating electricity. It causes a lot of pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases. These dirty methods of producing electricity have no place in world plagued by climate change. With this policy, we will be phasing out or outright banning all fossil fuel based power generation in the country. Capitalists will see this as a major distortion of the free market while environmentalists will be very happy to see fossil fuel power stations go away."
#,GenerationIVReactorRsrc,Generation IV reactors research,"Generation IV is the next generation of fission technology promissing increased safety, the ability to use mixed oxide fuel or the spent fuel from older generation reactors and increased efficiency. Reactor types include sodium cooled fast breeder reactors, molten salt reactors, lead-cooled fast reactors and many more experimental reactor types. With enough funding and time, maybe we can be the first country to produce reactors of this type on a large scale?"
#,GridStorageTechnology,Grid battery energy storage,"Grid energy storage refers to methods for storing energy within a power grid when there's a high supply and low demand. This is one of the possible methods to offset the disadvantages of renewable power, as it allows for the storage of electricity generated by renewable sources for later use. Battery storage is one method being researched as it doesn't require the massive amounts of land or special geographical factors that hydroelectricity needs. Battery storage stations are currently only deployed on a smaller scale, but with a dedicated and well funded project, we can be the one of the first countries in the world to roll this technology out on a large scale."
#,GlobalClimateChangeRsrc,Global climate change research funding,"Climate change is a global issue, not a national issue. With this policy, we'll be investing money into various international climate change research projects and that includes both increasing our understanding about climate change and also research on how to mitigate it."
#,ElectricityPriceControl,Electricity price control,"The free market approach to electricity doesn't always produce favorable results, but neither does a state monopoly on the energy market. This policy is a form of middle ground, where the energy sector remains privatized but the government regulates how much energy companies can charge their consumers. This is will anger capitalists but socialists will see this as a a step in the right direction with reducing economic inequality."
#,NuclearEducationCampaign,Nuclear power information campaign,"Nuclear power can seem scary to some people. They may think of disasters like Chernobyl or the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These people will have a negative attitude towards nuclear power because of this. This policy funds an information campaign that will hopefully show people that nuclear power is in fact very safe, good for the environment and that the risk for another Chernobyl is very low with the high safety standards our nuclear industry is keeping."
#,RollingBlackout,Rolling blackouts,"Desperate times calls for desperate measures. If all other options for preventing an electricity crisis have been exhausted, one measure that can be taken is rolling blackouts. These are intentional electricity shutdowns in different regions of the country at different times. This is often seen as a last resort measure to prevent a total blackout of the electricity grid and can have numerous negative effects on the economy and people if used too much or for too long."
#,NuclearWasteImport,Nuclear waste import,"If we already have a well developed nuclear industry that can manage its waste, and we have spare capacity left in our waste management system, we could import nuclear waste from other countries. Not only will we be improving our relations with other countries by helping them with handling their nuclear waste safely, we will also be earning money! Naturally, environmentalists will be quite upset by the fact that we're now importing highly radioactive waste."
#,FossilEnergySubsidy,Fossil fuel electricity subsidies,"While we realize climate change is a serious issue that needs to be addressed, we need to prioritize our energy security above that. We need reliable electricity right now and for as little money as possible. That means fossil fuel power generation such as coal fired power plants. This will upset environmentalists and increase the amount of fossil fuel based electricity in our electricity mix but it's necessary so we do not face a blackout or electricity shortage."
#,RenewablePowerBan,Renewable electricity ban,"In a time where the demand for electricity is constantly rising, we can't rely on power generation methods that depend on the weather. We need cheap and reliable electricity and because of that, we'll be banning renewable power from our power grid. Such a large intrusion into the free market will anger some people and environmentalists will see this as a step back in the fight against climate change."
#,wmds,Nuclear Arsenal,"Nuclear weaponry represents the pinnacle of humankind's destructive potential. Few inventions illustrate the dangers of technologically development in a more deadly way. While nuclear weaponry has only been used once in conflict, having an arsenal almost  gurantees you a major role on the global stage. The actual military applications and supplement remain low due to mutually-assurred-destruction, however. "
